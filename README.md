MyAdvisor is a proof-of-concept project that will feature a database layer, business logic coded in Scala and Java, and a browser-based front end.

### Disclaimer:
MyAdvisor was written as part of a course assignment to demonstrate relational database queries within the context of a simple application (insertion, selection, update, join, division, group by), and is not intended for use beyond this.  It is likely that MyAdvisor will not be actively developed after the conclusion of the class.
